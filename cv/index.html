  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I am a technical architect, developer, and devops engineer. I
    have extensive and wide-ranging experience building, leading and
    managing multi-disciplinary teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    From 2016 until February 2021, I have been working as a senior technical architect at the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a>, aside from a gap of one year during which I was the Head of Operations of <a href="https://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a>, a legaltech
    startup in the blockchain space.

    Most recently at the MoJ, I was working on the
    <a href="https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/concepts/about-the-cloud-platform.html">Cloud Platform</a>
    - a Kubernetes-based hosting platform for MoJ digital services. I have also worked on several public
    services aimed at facilitating citizen access to the UK justice system.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have designed, built and maintained performant, reliable and
    highly-scalable systems using a large variety of technologies,
    and worked in several successful startups, including one of my
    own, building and running development teams.

  <div class="collapsed">
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>
      I am an excellent communicator, with the ability to write
      clearly and convey information such that it is both easy
      to understand and, just as importantly, difficult to
      <i>mis</i>understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can talk to both technical and business people in ways
      that make sense, explaining technical concepts and
      constraints to the non-technical, and business realities
      to technical staff, without making either group feel
      belittled or frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an experienced and capable presenter, comfortable
      both on stage and on camera.

      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Blockchain</h3>

    <p>
      I have been interested in the potential of this space
      since 2015, and have studied and networked extensively to
      build up a deep understanding of different aspects of the
      underlying technology and the potential it offers.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result of this, I represented the MoJ in some
      cross-government initiatives to explore the the potential
      for blockchain technology to contribute to society, and
      was subsequently recruited to work as head of operations
      at <a href="https://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Ruby</h4>
        <p>
          I have been working primarily in Ruby since 2005, both in
          Rails applications and also using it with a variety of other
          frameworks, as well as standalone applications.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>
          It is impossible to write or maintain any significantly-complex
          web application these days, without using JavaScript. <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a>
          was no exception, making heavy use of JavaScript for
          interactivity. This became even more true when we undertook
          a significant rewrite, replacing much of the
          &lsquo;JQuery-style&rsquo; JS code with React.js components.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Go (Golang)</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the tools we are using and developing for the MoJ Cloud Platform are written in go, as you would expect in a kubernetes environment.
          In particular, I am one of the developers of our <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-cli">CLI tool</a>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Elixir</h4>
        <p>
          I started using Elixir in production systems in October
          2015, rewriting the core of the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a> ad-serving code from
          a PHP monolith to a multi-application Elixir system built
          on top of the Plug library.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Ethereum (Solidity)</h4>
        <p>
          I created prototypes and proofs of concept for Mattereum
          as distributed applications consisting of interacting
          Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, with
          front-end web applications written in React/NextJS.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Bash Scripting</h4>
        <p>
          The ubiquity of bash on Unix systems makes it a good choice
          for implementing quick pieces of &lsquo;glue&rsquo; code,
          to combine existing components. A lot of people underestimate
          bash scripting, but it is possible to write elegant and
          maintainable code in bash.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>PHP</h4>
        <p>
          When we created <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a> in 2006, we used an existing,
          open-source PHP ad-serving script as our initial starting
          point. So, I have been working with PHP since then. It&lsquo;s
          not a language I would choose to work in, but it is useful
          to be able to dig into legacy code.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frameworks</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>
        <p>
          I have built and maintained many applications in all versions
          of Ruby on Rails since version 2. The customer-facing web
          application at the heart of <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a> started as a Rails 2
          application, and I developed, maintained, and upgraded it
          several times. By March 2016 it was a Rails 4.2 application
          using React.js components, built using Google&lsquo;s
          Material Design principles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Padrino / Sinatra / Rack</h4>
        <p>
          For simple web endpoints, when Rails is overkill, these are
          the libraries I use to get things up and running quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Phoenix</h4>
        <p>
          I&lsquo;ve been using Phoenix in production since October
          2015, and really enjoying it. It provides almost all the
          developer benefits of Rails, without compromising performance
          or introducing too much &lsquo;magic&rsquo;.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>React.js</h4>
        <p>
          In May 2015 we started replacing the &lsquo;JQuery-style&rsquo;
          JavaScript code in the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a> web application with React.js
          components. Encapsulating in a single JSX file both the
          behaviour of a component and the layout on which it operates
          made the application a lot easier to maintain and develop.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DevOps Tools</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Kubernetes</h4>
        <p>
          I am currently working as the Technical Architect on the MoJ Cloud Platform team.
          The Cloud Platform is a hosting platform for the MoJ's digital services, consisting
          of a kubernetes cluster plus ancillary products and services including Elastic Search
          Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, Fluentd, Concourse, CircleCI, Auth0 and probably a few
          more things I've forgotten.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Terraform</h4>
        <p>
          The MoJ Cloud Platform makes extensive use of Terraform,
          with the entire platform being defined across several
          open-source github repositories.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Docker</h4>
        <p>
          I&lsquo;ve been using Docker since the end of 2014, when I
          used it as a key part of the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a>
          adserver infrastructure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Unix System Administration</h4>
        <p>
          I have been using Linux (mostly Ubuntu) in one form or
          another since 2001. I am very comfortable with the unix
          command-line, and administering and maintaining unix servers,
          both for development and production purposes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Puppet</h4>
        <p>
          Since 2010, I&lsquo;ve been using Puppet as the primary
          configuration management tool for <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a>, building and
          managing a wide variety of server types. Configuration
          management gave us a lot of flexibility, enabling machines
          to be replaced or upgraded very quickly, and keeping our
          infrastructure nimble.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Ansible &amp; Chef</h4>
        <p>
          Although I&lsquo;ve used these a lot less, I like the
          lightweight &lsquo;push&rsquo; nature of Ansible. I tend
          to use it for my own projects, and I might consider using
          it, instead of Puppet, for a large project, depending on
          the requirements. I have played with Chef, but haven&lsquo;t
          used it in production.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cloud Platforms</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Amazon Web Services</h4>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a> uses AWS extensively, so I have
          been using it since starting to work there. I wouldn&lsquo;t
          describe myself as expert, but I can find my way around.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Google Compute Engine</h4>
        <p>
          We moved virtually all of our infrastructure to GCE in
          May/June 2015, taking advantage of several unique features
          including live migration, pre-emptible VMs, and Google
          Container Registry for our Docker images.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Google BigQuery</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a> generated around 1TB of transaction data every day.
          While I was running Admoda, we used Google BigQuery to analyse this data and expose
          summary information for our customers in a best-in-class
          analytics tool, to help advertisers target their campaigns,
          and publishers to get the best value from their mobile
          traffic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Heroku</h4>
        <p>
          I started using Heroku when doing some contract programming
          for 38 degrees, a UK non-profit campaigning organisation.
          I don&lsquo;t have a lot of experience with it, but I like
          what I&lsquo;ve seen, so far. I think it&lsquo;s an excellent
          choice when you want to keep your devops workload to a
          minimum, and if hosting costs are not significant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Rackspace</h4>
        <p>
          When I was running Admoda, we used Rackspace as our primary hosting provider until May 2015.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Mattereum aims to bring blockchain smart contracts into the
      real world in a way that will be genuinely practical for
      international trade, with a rigorous legal foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a member of the management team, I worked closely with a group
      of insanely smart founders and experts to realise this vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also developed proof of concept applications which combined

    <h3>2016 – 2018 Senior Technical Architect at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a></h3>
    <p>
      Working as part of multi-disciplinary, agile teams, I worked
      on a variety of projects including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal">Appeal to the Tax Tribunal</a>, taking the service through to public beta.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed and helped to implement an architecture based on
      loosely-coupled services intended to be drop-in components that
      other services can use (e.g. a virus-scanning <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojfile-uploader">file-uploader</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      I also helped to create a
      <a href="https://github.com/digitalronin/rails-decision-tree-experiment">design pattern for Ruby on Rails</a>,
      applicable to any forms-based
      service that needs to classify users based on their path through
      a flowchart (aka a decision-tree).
    </p>
    <p>
      A more developed version of this design underpins the Appeal to the Tax Tribunal service.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also participated in discussions and research on potential
      uses for distributed ledger (blockchain) technology, both within
      the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a>, and in working groups with a broader
      government perspective.
    </p>

    <h3>2006 – 2016 CTO &amp; Co-Founder of <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2634-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-admoda">Admoda</a></h3>
    <p>
      We created Admoda in 2006, and were the second mobile ad network
      to launch (we thought we were the first, but Admob beat us by
      a week). Admoda was a self-serve system which enabled owners
      of applications and websites to earn money from their mobile
      traffic by showing ads. Advertisers registered pre-pay accounts
      on the system, and then created and managed ad campaigns using
      our online tools to upload and manage their creative assets,
      and control the targeting of their campaigns (country, mobile
      network, device manufacturer, operating system, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We were up and running within three months of the initial
      decision to launch, and were profitable within another three.
      We continued to be profitable for the next ten years. Initially,
      I worked on the system in my spare time, gradually transitioning
      to working on it full-time by early 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front-end was a Ruby on Rails application that went through
      various incarnations, including a major rewrite to incorporate
      React.js with a complete re-skin to use Material Design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back end initially consisted of servers running an open
      source PHP ad-serving script, which I had modified to add mobile
      device detection and targeting capabilities. By the time we
      wound up the business, the back end was a cloud-hosted auto-scaling
      “farm” of stateless adservers, each of which comprised a number
      of loosely-coupled micro-services (geo-location, device
      recognition, ad selection, etc.), with each service running in
      its own Docker container. The primary core of the system was
      written in Elixir, with RabbitMQ as the messaging backbone,
      with everything orchestrated via a Consul service discovery
      cluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      At busy times, there would be hundreds of adservers, scaling
      down to just a handful at quiet periods. The system was highly
      resilient, with no single points of failure, and was very closely
      monitored by several different services. This enabled us to
      keep hosting and system administration costs to a minimum, yet
      still handle billions of transactions per day, and millions of
      pounds of turnover, with a team of just three people (that&lsquo;s
      the whole company, not just the technical team).
    </p>

    <h3>2005 – 2009 Technical Architect at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mobile-interactive-group">Mobile Interactive Group</a></h3>
    <p>
      I was the fourth person, and the first technical hire, at this
      startup. I helped build and lead the development team, designing,
      creating and managing a wide variety of applications around different
      mobile customer experiences (such as voting, ticketing, mobile
      payments and customer rewards systems), handling traffic loads up
      to several million transactions per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked in Perl initially, but quickly transitioned to Ruby in
      2006, using Rails for our front-end applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other projects, I worked on the voting application used for
      TV shows such as The X Factor, the SMS ticket lottery for the Live8
      charity concert, and a loyalty rewards programme for customers of
      the Orange mobile phone network.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I left, in 2009, the company had grown to 100+
      staff, with twelve in the technical team.
    </p>

    <h3>2001 – 2005 Developer at <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/">O2</a> UK</h3>
    <p>
      Working mostly in Perl but also using some Python, I created and
      maintained a wide variety of applications for O2 as part of their
      in-house development team. In particular, I designed and built the
      first SMS voting system for interactive TV shows including “I&lsquo;m
      a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here”, Big Brother and Pop Idol.
