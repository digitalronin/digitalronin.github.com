<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
  I am a developer, technical architect and devops engineer. I have
  extensive and wide-ranging experience building and maintaining
  performant, reliable and highly-scalable systems using a large
  variety of technologies. I have built, led and managed teams of
  developers and worked in two successful startups, including one
  of my own.
</p>

<h2><a id="skills" href="#" class="collapse">Skills</a></h2>
<div class="collapsed">
  <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Ruby</h4>
      <p>
	I have been working primarily in Ruby since 2005, both in
	Rails applications and also using it with a variety of other
	frameworks, as well as standalone applications.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Elixir</h4>
      <p>
	I started using Elixir in production systems in October
	2015, rewriting the core of the Admoda ad-serving code from
	a PHP monolith to a multi-application Elixir system built
	on top of the Plug library.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>JavaScript</h4>
      <p>
	It is impossible to write or maintain any significantly-complex
	web application these days, without using JavaScript. Admoda
	was no exception, making heavy use of JavaScript for
	interactivity. This became even more true when we undertook
	a significant rewrite, replacing much of the
	&lsquo;JQuery-style&rsquo; JS code with React.js components.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Bash Scripting</h4>
      <p>
	The ubiquity of bash on Unix systems makes it a good choice
	for implementing quick pieces of &lsquo;glue&rsquo; code,
	to combine existing components. A lot of people underestimate
	bash scripting, but it is possible to write elegant and
	maintainable code in bash.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>PHP</h4>
      <p>
	When we created Admoda in 2006, we used an existing,
	open-source PHP ad-serving script as our initial starting
	point. So, I have been working with PHP since then. It&lsquo;s
	not a language I would choose to work in, but it is useful
	to be able to dig into legacy code.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Frameworks</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>
      <p>
	I have built and maintained many applications in all versions
	of Ruby on Rails since version 2. The customer-facing web
	application at the heart of Admoda started as a Rails 2
	application, and I developed, maintained, and upgraded it
	several times. By March 2016 it was a Rails 4.2 application
	using React.js components, built using Google&lsquo;s
	Material Design principles.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Padrino / Sinatra / Rack</h4>
      <p>
	For simple web endpoints, when Rails is overkill, these are
	the libraries I use to get things up and running quickly.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Phoenix</h4>
      <p>
	I&lsquo;ve been using Phoenix in production since October
	2015, and really enjoying it. It provides almost all the
	developer benefits of Rails, without compromising performance
	or introducing too much &lsquo;magic&rsquo;.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>React.js</h4>
      <p>
	In May 2015 we started replacing the &lsquo;JQuery-style&rsquo;
	JavaScript code in the Admoda web application with React.js
	components. Encapsulating in a single JSX file both the
	behaviour of a component and the layout on which it operates
	made the application a lot easier to maintain and develop.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Ember.js</h4>
      <p>
	I started teaching myself Ember.js in April 2016, purely
	for my own interest. I wouldn&lsquo;t say I&lsquo;m capable
	of developing a significant application in it, yet, but I
	could work on an existing application, if required.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>DevOps Tools</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Unix System Administration</h4>
      <p>
	I have been using Linux (mostly Ubuntu) in one form or
	another since 2001. I am very comfortable with the unix
	command-line, and administering and maintaining unix servers,
	both for development and production purposes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Puppet</h4>
      <p>
	Since 2010, I&lsquo;ve been using Puppet as the primary
	configuration management tool for Admoda, building and
	managing a wide variety of server types. Configuration
	management gave us a lot of flexibility, enabling machines
	to be replaced or upgraded very quickly, and keeping our
	infrastructure nimble.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Ansible &amp; Chef</h4>
      <p>
	Although I&lsquo;ve used these a lot less, I like the
	lightweight &lsquo;push&rsquo; nature of Ansible. I tend
	to use it for my own projects, and I might consider using
	it, instead of Puppet, for a large project, depending on
	the requirements. I have played with Chef, but haven&lsquo;t
	used it in production.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Docker</h4>
      <p>
	I&lsquo;ve been using Docker since the end of 2014, when I
	converted Admoda adservers from Ubuntu VMs running several
	different software services to a collection of Docker
	containers, each exposing a single service. I think it can
	offer a lot, when used appropriately, although there are
	still some gotchas to avoid.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cloud Platforms</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Amazon Web Services</h4>
      <p>
	The Ministry of Justice uses AWS extensively, so I have
	been using it since starting to work there. I wouldn&lsquo;t
	describe myself as expert, but I can find my way around.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Google Compute Engine</h4>
      <p>
	We moved virtually all of our infrastructure to GCE in
	May/June 2015, taking advantage of several unique features
	including live migration, pre-emptible VMs, and Google
	Container Registry for our Docker images.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Google BigQuery</h4>
      <p>
	Admoda generated around 1TB of transaction data every day.
	We used Google BigQuery to analyse this data and expose
	summary information for our customers in a best-in-class
	analytics tool, to help advertisers target their campaigns,
	and publishers to get the best value from their mobile
	traffic.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Heroku</h4>
      <p>
	I started using Heroku when doing some contract programming
	for 38 degrees, a UK non-profit campaigning organisation.
	I don&lsquo;t have a lot of experience with it, but I like
	what I&lsquo;ve seen, so far. I think it&lsquo;s an excellent
	choice when you want to keep your devops workload to a
	minimum, and if hosting costs are not significant.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Rackspace</h4>
      <p>
        We used Rackspace as our primary hosting provider until May 2015.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2><a id="experience" href="#" class="collapse">Experience</a></h2>

<div class="collapsed">
  <h3>2016 – present Technical Architect at the Ministry of Justice</h3>
  <p>
    Working as part of multi-disciplinary, agile teams, I worked
    on a variety of projects including <a
    href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal">Appeal to the Tax
    Tribunal</a>, taking the service through to public beta.
  </p>
  <p>
    I designed and helped to implement an architecture based on
    loosely-coupled services intended to be drop-in components that
    other services can use (e.g. a virus-scanning <a
    href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojfile-uploader">file-uploader</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    I also helped to create a <a
    href="https://github.com/digitalronin/rails-decision-tree-experiment">design
    pattern for Ruby on Rails</a>, applicable to any forms-based
    service that needs to classify users based on their path through
    a flowchart (aka a decision-tree).
  </p>
  <p>
    A more developed version of this design underpins the Appeal to the Tax Tribunal service.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also participated in discussions and research on potential
    uses for distributed ledger technology, both within the Ministry
    of Justice, and in working groups with a broader government
    perspective.
  </p>

  <h3>2006 – 2016 CTO &amp; Co-Founder of Admoda</h3>
  <p>
    We created Admoda in 2006, and were the second mobile ad network
    to launch (we thought we were the first, but Admob beat us by
    a week). Admoda was a self-serve system which enabled owners
    of applications and websites to earn money from their mobile
    traffic by showing ads. Advertisers registered pre-pay accounts
    on the system, and then created and managed ad campaigns using
    our online tools to upload and manage their creative assets,
    and control the targeting of their campaigns (country, mobile
    network, device manufacturer, operating system, etc.)
  </p>
  <p>
    We were up and running within three months of the initial
    decision to launch, and were profitable within another three.
    We continued to be profitable for the next ten years. Initially,
    I worked on the system in my spare time, gradually transitioning
    to working on it full-time by early 2009.
</p>
  <p>
    The front-end was a Ruby on Rails application that went through
    various incarnations, including a major rewrite to incorporate
    React.js with a complete re-skin to use Material Design.
</p>
  <p>
    The back end initially consisted of servers running an open
    source PHP ad-serving script, which I had modified to add mobile
    device detection and targeting capabilities. By the time we
    wound up the business, the back end was a cloud-hosted auto-scaling
    “farm” of stateless adservers, each of which comprised a number
    of loosely-coupled micro-services (geo-location, device
    recognition, ad selection, etc.), with each service running in
    its own Docker container. The primary core of the system was
    written in Elixir, with RabbitMQ as the messaging backbone,
    with everything orchestrated via a Consul service discovery
    cluster.
</p>
  <p>
    At busy times, there would be hundreds of adservers, scaling
    down to just a handful at quiet periods. The system was highly
    resilient, with no single points of failure, and was very closely
    monitored by several different services. This enabled us to
    keep hosting and system administration costs to a minimum, yet
    still handle billions of transactions per day, and millions of
    pounds of turnover, with a team of just three people (that&lsquo;s
    the whole company, not just the technical team).
</p>

  <h3>2005 – 2009 Technical Architect at Mobile Interactive Group</h3>
  <p>
I was the fourth person, and the first technical hire, at this
startup. I helped build and lead the development team, designing,
creating and managing a wide variety of applications around different
mobile customer experiences (such as voting, ticketing, mobile
payments and customer rewards systems), handling traffic loads up
to several million transactions per hour.
  </p>
  <p>
We worked in Perl initially, but quickly transitioned to Ruby in
2006, using Rails for our front-end applications.
  </p>
  <p>
Amongst other projects, I worked on the voting application used for
TV shows such as The X Factor, the SMS ticket lottery for the Live8
charity concert, and a loyalty rewards programme for customers of
the Orange mobile phone network.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time I left, in 2009, the company had grown to 100+
    staff, with twelve in the technical team.
  </p>

  <h3>2001 – 2005 Developer at O2 UK</h3>
  <p>
Working mostly in Perl but also using some Python, I created and
maintained a wide variety of applications for O2 as part of their
in-house development team. In particular, I designed and built the
first SMS voting system for interactive TV shows including “I&lsquo;m
a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here”, Big Brother and Pop Idol.
