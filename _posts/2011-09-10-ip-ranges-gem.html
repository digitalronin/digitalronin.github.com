<p>I just published a <a title="IP Ranges gem on rubygems.org" href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ip-ranges" target="_blank">gem</a> to help manage ranges of IP numbers.</p>
<p>It allows you to take lots of arbitrary IP data like this;</p>
<ul>
<li>1.2.3.4</li>
<li>1.2.1.254..1.3.4.4</li>
<li>1.2.0.0/16</li>
</ul>
<p>...and find out which ranges include or overlap with others. In this case, it provides output like this;</p>
<div>
<pre>1.2.3.4 is contained by range 1.2.1.254..1.3.4.4
1.2.3.4 is contained by range 1.2.0.0/16
1.2.1.254..1.3.4.4 overlaps with 1.2.0.0/16</pre>
</div>
<p>Here's the <a title="github.com" href="https://github.com/digitalronin/IP-Ranges-Gem" target="_blank">source</a>.</p>
